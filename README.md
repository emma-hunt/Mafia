# Mafia
Mafia phone app for BYU CS 428, a Senior capstone project.

Mafia is an app designed for android and iOS, built using Flutter. The multiplayer app is an interface and game manager for the popular slumber party game Mafia, or One Night Werewolf. The game is intended for a group of 3-10 players who are in the same room. After joining the game using a unique game code, players are assigned roles and given an overview of their role, as well as the other potential roles in the game. The app then acts as game master and prompts the users to take an action for their role, discuss with other players, and make accusations.
